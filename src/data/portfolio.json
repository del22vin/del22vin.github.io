      "description": "\n img-cratic-1.jpg\nMy journey began by identifying a major bottleneck in Cratic AI’s growth. High-intent leads were ready to buy, but they were forced into a Book a Call loop. Research showed that customers wanted to purchase immediately rather than waiting for a scheduled sales demo. This friction created a gap between intent and activation.\n img-cratic-2.jpg\nI focused on Mary, an HR Manager and Team Lead. Her goal is efficiency: she needs to acquire tools quickly, comply with budgets, and delegate technical setup to others. Her biggest challenge was the lack of a transparent purchase flow and the time-consuming manual onboarding process.\n img-cratic-3.jpg\nThe core challenge was clear: Mary needs a way to purchase B2B software instantly, verify pricing, and delegate the technical Admin setup to her team. I aimed to bridge the gap between Buyer (Mary) and Admin (Technical Lead) through a seamless digital handoff.\n img-cratic-4.jpg\nThe strategy involved creating two distinct paths:The Purchase Flow: A streamlined checkout where the Buyer can finalize seats and payment.The Setup Guide: A post-purchase environment that allows the Buyer to either set up the product themselves or send an Admin Link to a team member to handle the technical details.I started with low-fidelity wireframes to map out the 5-step setup process. This included defining team names, assigning members, and setting huddle schedules. Early testing focused on whether a user could navigate these steps without feeling overwhelmed by the data entry required.The Welcome to Cratic.ai screen was designed as the gateway. I included a clear value proposition, Set up in 5 quick steps, while providing a Skip for Now option to ensure users never felt trapped in the onboarding flow.\n img-cratic-6.jpg\nDuring usability testing, I discovered that users needed more flexibility. I iterated on the Huddle Schedule screen by adding an Apply to all teams checkbox and Check schedule features. These small functional additions significantly reduced the manual effort required for managers handling large departments.\n img-cratic-7.jpg\n\n img-cratic-8.jpg\n\n img-cratic-9.jpg\nThe final high-fidelity prototype applied Cratic AI’s brand identity, utilizing the Inter font and a professional color palette. I refined the input controls—using a combination of increment buttons and editable fields for seat counts—to provide a tactile, flexible user experience that felt both modern and reliable.\n img-cratic-10.jpg\nThe final solution successfully removed the Sales Gate, allowing for 24/7 customer acquisition. By designing for the specific needs of the Buyer-Admin relationship, I created a product experience that is as easy to buy as it is to use.",

      "summary": "Designed a modernized business card of a flooring company while honoring their long history and commitment to quality",
      "description": "For a company specializing in hardwood, the visual connection to their product was essential. \n I presented the client with two distinct design directions: one utilizing modern flat colors and another featuring rich wood-grain patterns. The client selected the textured approach, which provides an immediate tactile and visual association with their craft. To ensure brand continuity, I anchored the design with their signature corporate black, creating a high-contrast, premium look that feels as sturdy as the floors they install. \n Since Smith Bros. Floors has been in operation since 1918, it was important to convey their expertise and steady growth. I implemented a dynamic diagonal line that cuts across the card from left to right, moving upward to symbolize a trajectory of sustained success. This is further reinforced by the triangular geometric elements in the top right corner. These shapes serve as metaphors for mountains or upward-pointing arrows, representing ambition, growth, and the peak of professional quality. \n The card’s layout is designed for maximum clarity in a sales environment. By isolating the contact information on the warm wood-toned section, I ensured that the name and credentials of the representative remain the primary focus. The inclusion of the heritage logo and the established date prominently at the top reinforces a sense of trust and reliability, reminding potential clients that they are dealing with ‘The Hardwood Floor Experts.’",

      "description": "The brand name, TRI-C, stems from the founder’s observation of patterns of three in his life and his own name, Chris. To honor this, I meticulously woven the element of three throughout the entire visual identity. The logo features three distinct colors (Red, Yellow, and Black), three lightning bolt rays at the crown, three rods on the internal plug icon, and three yellow coils at the base of the bulb. This subtle repetition creates a cohesive and meaningful brand story that is deeply personal to the client. \n The centerpiece of the design is a lightbulb that integrates multiple industry-specific visuals. I designed the filament to double as a power plug, immediately identifying the company’s core service. Furthermore, I incorporated a black ‘disk’ or swoosh around the center of the bulb, which I shaped to subtly form the letter ‘C,’ a nod to both the brand name and the founder. This layering of symbols ensures the logo is both functional and intellectually engaging. \n The client requested a high-energy palette of red, yellow, and black. I chose to utilize gradients to give the logo a modern, three-dimensional feel, allowing the warm tones to ‘glow’ like an active light source. For the typography, I ensured ‘TRI-C’ remained the most prominent text element, using a bold, italicized font that conveys speed, energy, and reliability—essential traits for an electrical service provider.",

By applying the same fluid, wave-inspired graphics found in the banner, I created a consistent brand experience across all physical marketing materials. This teal hue was specifically chosen to evoke feelings of clinical cleanliness and modern, high-quality care. \n The folder’s layout prioritizes a clean and uncluttered aesthetic to help patients feel calm and organized. The front cover clearly displays the clinic’s tagline—'Your Quality and Accessible Dental Care in Calgary'—anchored by the primary logo. To maximize utility, I included a streamlined list of core services, such as Hygiene, Orthodontics, and Dentures, ensuring that the practice’s full scope is visible at a glance. \n To bridge the gap between physical and digital engagement, I integrated a high-visibility 'SCAN ME!' QR code on the front cover. This allows patients to easily access the clinic’s website or booking portal directly from their mobile devices. The footer includes consistent contact details, including the website URL, physical address, and phone number, ensuring all essential communication channels are readily available.",

      "description": "While the clinic’s core branding is a minimalist black and white, this project required a more dynamic palette to stand out in a busy event environment. I introduced a teal and blue-green color scheme to symbolize clinical cleanliness and modern care. This splash of color provides a refreshing contrast to the black and white logo, making the banner feel vibrant and inviting without losing its professional edge. \n The primary goal was to entice potential new patients using a 'gift option' strategy. I created a dedicated 'New Patient Exam Gift Options' section, utilizing product photography and clean layout boxes to clearly present the choice between a Philips Sonicare toothbrush or a whitening kit. By highlighting the word 'FREE' and using a structured 'Gift Options' area, I created a compelling visual hook that speaks directly to their interests. \n To ensure the broad capabilities were communicated at a glance, a section showing their services is provided. Each service—from Orthodontics to Emergency Care—is paired with a minimalist line icon to aid in quick scannability. The design is anchored by a prominent 'SCAN ME!' QR code and clear contact icons at the bottom, ensuring that the transition from interested passerby to new patient is as seamless as possible.",

To achieve this, I utilized the client’s brand color palette, leaning into soft pinks and vibrant yellows to create a warm, approachable feel. By integrating playful graphic elements—such as the JOY typography with a built-in smile and subtle sparkle icons—I ensured the design felt at home in a concert setting while maintaining the integrity of a healthcare provider. \n Since the target audience consisted of younger concert-goers, the visual hierarchy needed to be modern and engaging rather than rigid. I used dynamic, fluid wave shapes to break up the sections, moving away from traditional boxy layouts. This professional-yet-playful approach was designed specifically to build trust; it presents Joy Cortez-Benitez as an expert who is both highly qualified and personally relatable, making dental care feel less intimidating to a younger demographic. \n Beyond aesthetics, the banner serves as a functional touchpoint for the booth. I ensured that all essential information—from the service list to the physical location—was organized for quick scanning. I strategically placed a high-contrast QR code in the bottom corner for immediate 'Book Now' accessibility, allowing busy event attendees to engage with the business instantly without needing to stop and type in a URL.",
